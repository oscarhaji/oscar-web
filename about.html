<p>Hello! My name is Oscar Haji, I’m 21 years old. I’m a student in Medical Laboratory, but I dream of becoming one of the best women programmers.</p>
<br>
<p>I love learning new things, especially about programming and web development. Whenever I take a new course, I enjoy applying what I’ve learned in small projects.</p>
<br/>
<p>I admire great programmers, especially women in tech, and I’m always excited to improve my skills and create something useful.</p>
